  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Kidus' Coding Journey</h3></summary>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm <strong>Kidus Basazinew</strong> — a passionate and self-driven <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> with hands-on experience in <strong>Back-End Development</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey in tech began with a childhood curiosity. I loved playing video games and watching animations, always wondering <em>"how do they make these?"</em> That curiosity led me into game development, where I started exploring how games are built.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although game dev was exciting, I realized it involves many complex areas — like physics engines and simulations — that were difficult to handle on my own, especially as a beginner.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, I shifted to <strong>web development</strong>, and that’s where everything clicked. I quickly picked up <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, followed by <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Each stage of learning was exciting — I built projects like a calculator, weather app, and e-commerce layout.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning <strong>React</strong> was a game-changer, and diving into <strong>Next.js</strong> brought full-stack power to my skillset — from routing to API handling.
  </p>

  <p>
    I later explored backend technologies like <strong>CRUD operations</strong>, <strong>ORMs</strong>, and <strong>database integrations</strong>. This enabled me to create real-world, production-level applications.
  </p>

  <p>Some of my notable projects include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🏨 A <strong>Hotel Management System</strong> with full backend integration.</li>
    <li>🍽️ A <strong>Restaurant Table Booking and Ordering System</strong>.</li>
    <li>🧠 An <strong>AI-Based Travel Planner</strong> that checks weather conditions and recommends dynamic trips.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I love solving real-world problems through code and constantly explore new tools, technologies, and ways to build impactful solutions.
