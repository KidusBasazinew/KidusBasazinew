 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
Hi, I'm Kidus Basazinew ‚Äî a passionate and self-driven Front-End Developer with hands-on experience in Back-End Development.
  <br/>
My journey in tech started with a childhood curiosity. I loved playing video games and watching animations, always wondering "how do they make these?" That curiosity led me into game development, where I started exploring how games are built. Although I found it exciting, I soon realized that creating games involves many complex areas ‚Äî from physics engines to simulations ‚Äî which were hard to handle alone, especially as a beginner.
  <br/>
So, I pivoted to web development, and that‚Äôs where everything clicked. I quickly picked up HTML and CSS, then moved on to JavaScript. Each stage was exciting ‚Äî I built simple yet fun projects like a calculator, weather app, and e-commerce layouts. Learning React was a game-changer, and diving into Next.js added powerful routing and full-stack capabilities to my toolbox.
  <br/>
As I progressed, I expanded into the backend world ‚Äî working with CRUD operations, ORMs, and database integrations. This allowed me to build complete, production-level applications. Some of my notable projects include:
<ul>
<li>A Hotel Management System with full integration.</li>
<li>A Restaurant Table Booking and Ordering System.</li>
<li>An AI-Based Travel Planner that dynamically checks weather conditions and recommends trips ‚Äî a standout project showcasing AI integration and creative problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
I love solving real-world problems through code, and I'm always exploring new technologies and building impactful projects.
